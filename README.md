# assignment-1-webtech
This is assignment 1 in PROG2053 Web Technologies. The assignment revolved around making a website using HTML, JavaScript for functionality, and with CSS for styling. This website has three pages: Home, Weather and More. Home is designed to look as closely as possible to a provided reference image. Weather displays weather data for six cities(Seattle,Detroit,Oslo,Tokyo,Moscow,Bras√≠lia), using the  Open-Meteo API. The More page dynamically loads and displays posts from the JSONPlaceholder API using AJAX, without you needing to reload the page.

## Features

* __Current Weather Display:__ Automatically fetches and updates weather data for the six cities every few minutes.
* __Dynamically Loaded Posts:__ Displays posts in a grid with a "load more" feature that automatically loads in additional posts as you scroll.
* __Custom Styling:__ A custom written CSS file that styles the pages to be consistent with the reference and each other. 
* __APIs:__
  - [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/)
  - [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)
